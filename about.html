          <h1>What is Pediatrics?</h1>
          <p>
            Paediatrics is the branch of medicine dealing with the health and
            medical care of infants, children, and adolescents from birth up to
            the age of 18. The word “paediatrics” means “healer of children”;
            they are derived from two Greek words: (pais = child) and (iatros =
            doctor or healer). Paediatrics is a relatively new medical
            specialty, developing only in the mid-19th century. Abraham Jacobi
            (1830–1919) is known as the father of paediatrics.

          <h1>What does a pediatrician do?</h1>
          <p>
            A paediatrician is a child's physician who provides not only medical
            care for children who are acutely or chronically ill but also
            preventive health services for healthy children. A paediatrician
            manages physical, mental, and emotional well-being of the children
            under their care at every stage of development, in both sickness and
            health.
